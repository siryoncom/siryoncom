# F.A.Q

Here's some answers to frequently asked questions

## Why does ESX not use Steam as identification anymore? 

Steam identification was ditched the same time as when we ditched essentialmode. The reason is that the Steam identifier does not always belong to a Steam account that owns the game.

- Players who buy a non-Steam copy of the game have the key tied to the Rockstar account - only
- Players who buy a Steam copy of the game have the game tied to a Steam and Rockstar account

This means that non-Steam players can join your server with different Steam accounts to for example get the starting account balances.

The Rockstar identification tied to the game copy, this way if people want to for example farm starting account balances they will have to acquire game keys. Because of all this the Steam identifier is not eligable to use to identify a player.
